                <p> This is the best school.. And the teacher & staff members are very supportive.. Here's the teachers are very talented they know how to teach students very well & how to engage in clss,I suggest anyone to come this school..This the the
                    best school in this whole area it is best in everything dance, studies, English speaking and other activities.You can study CBSE board here and it's a christan school that's why instead of having a principal and vise principal, we
                    have sisters as principal, but any religious can came here either as a student or as a teacher to teach, but the principal will always a sister or nun.

                    like christmas, easter, children's day, teacher's day etc we have a special holy prayer in it.It's always clean and as the church is not inside our campus, but still our school property and even when the school is closed it church
                    is open for 24/7</p>

                    books of their choice and issue the books. I love visiting the library because their are more than 150 boos to read and new books keep adding. They are of different topic like astronomy, science, history, space, stories in hindi and
                    english, comics etc.</p>
